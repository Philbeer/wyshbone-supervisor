You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Supervisor repl.

We are using Wyshbone Control Tower to track progress on agentic tasks like SUP-001, SUP-002, etc. Control Tower already reads a status/export JSON from this repl and from the UI repl.

On the UI side, we added a boolean flag ui001_goalCaptureEnabled to the UI status JSON, and Control Tower uses that to automatically mark UI-001 as done when it is true.

I now want to do the same thing for Supervisor tasks, by exposing simple boolean flags in this repl’s status/export so Control Tower can mark Supervisor tasks as implemented.

Please make the following small, focused changes:

1. Find the server-side code in this Supervisor repl that serves the status/export JSON for Control Tower.
   - This will be the endpoint that Poller / Control Tower calls to get information about the Supervisor (e.g. app name, version, fix-me count, tools/routes, etc.).
   - It might be something like /export/status.json or similar.

2. In the JSON object returned by this endpoint, add boolean fields for the Supervisor-side tasks we care about. Use these exact keys:

   - For SUP-001 (lead generation plan object):
     "sup001_plannerEnabled": <boolean>

   - For SUP-002 (plan executor):
     "sup002_executorEnabled": <boolean>

   - For SUP-003 (background goal monitor):
     "sup003_monitorEnabled": <boolean>

   - For SUP-060 (safe-mode experiments / exploration):
     "sup060_safeExperimentsEnabled": <boolean>

3. For now, you can set the values as follows:
   - If the corresponding feature is already implemented and wired in this repl, set the flag to true.
   - If the feature is not implemented yet, set the flag to false.
   - It’s fine if initially some of these are false; Control Tower will keep those tasks as planned until we implement them.

   The important part is that the keys exist and are part of the status JSON.

4. Keep the rest of the status/export JSON unchanged:
   - Do not remove existing fields.
   - Do not rename existing properties.
   - Only add these four boolean properties.

5. Make sure the response shape is stable so Control Tower can reliably read it. For example, a typical status JSON object should now include something like:

   {
     "app": "wyshbone-supervisor",
     "version": "...",
     "sup001_plannerEnabled": true or false,
     "sup002_executorEnabled": true or false,
     "sup003_monitorEnabled": true or false,
     "sup060_safeExperimentsEnabled": true or false,
     ...other existing fields...
   }

6. After implementing, run the server and verify that hitting the Supervisor status/export endpoint returns these fields with the expected boolean values.

Please keep the changes minimal and focused on adding these four flags to the status/export JSON, and do not refactor unrelated parts of the Supervisor.
